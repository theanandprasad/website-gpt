# Website GPT - Technical Specifications

## Project Overview
Website GPT is a web application that allows users to enter a URL of any website and then ask questions about its content. The application will scrape the website content, process it, and use AI to provide accurate answers to user queries about the website's information.

## Core Features
1. **Website URL Input**: Users can enter the URL of any website they want to query.
2. **Content Extraction**: The application will scrape and extract content from the provided website.
3. **Chat Interface**: Users can ask questions about the website content through a chat interface.
4. **AI-Powered Answers**: The application will provide accurate answers based on the website content.
5. **Session Management**: Users can switch between different websites within a session.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux (if complexity requires)
- **Chat Interface**: Custom chat UI with message history

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express.js
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for website processing and chat functionality
- **Web Scraping**: Cheerio or Puppeteer for content extraction
- **Content Processing**: Text extraction, cleaning, and chunking

### AI Integration
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4) with potential fallback to open-source alternatives like Ollama
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone (free tier) or ChromaDB (open source) for storing embeddings
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings API or open-source alternatives (e.g., sentence-transformers)

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier) for frontend and serverless functions
- **Database**: Supabase (free tier) for storing user sessions and website metadata
- **Caching**: Redis (optional, if needed for performance)

## Implementation Details

### Website Content Processing Pipeline
1. **URL Validation**: Ensure the provided URL is valid and accessible
2. **Content Extraction**: Scrape the website content (HTML)
3. **Content Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary elements (ads, navigation, etc.)
4. **Text Extraction**: Extract meaningful text content
5. **Content Chunking**: Split content into manageable chunks
6. **Embedding Generation**: Generate vector embeddings for each chunk
7. **Storage**: Store embeddings in vector database with metadata

### Question-Answering Flow
1. **User Query**: Receive question from user
2. **Query Processing**: Clean and process the question
3. **Semantic Search**: Find relevant content chunks using vector similarity
4. **Context Assembly**: Assemble relevant chunks into a context window
5. **LLM Query**: Send question and context to LLM for answer generation
6. **Response Delivery**: Return the generated answer to the user

### Data Storage
- **Website Metadata**: URL, title, timestamp of scraping
- **Content Chunks**: Text segments with their vector embeddings
- **User Sessions**: Track which websites a user has queried
- **Chat History**: Store conversation history for context

## Technical Constraints and Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting for website scraping to avoid overloading target websites
- Implement rate limiting for AI API calls to manage costs

### Error Handling
- Handle cases where websites block scraping
- Gracefully handle API failures or timeouts
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### Privacy and Security
- Do not store sensitive user data
- Implement proper input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Consider implementing content filtering for inappropriate websites

### Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for previously scraped websites
- Optimize chunk size for balance between context relevance and token usage
- Consider lazy loading for chat history

## Free Tools and Services

### Development
- **GitHub**: Version control and project management
- **VS Code**: Code editing and development

### Frontend
- **React.js/Next.js**: Open-source frontend frameworks
- **Tailwind CSS**: Open-source CSS framework
- **Vercel**: Free tier for hosting

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express.js**: Open-source server technologies
- **Cheerio/Puppeteer**: Open-source web scraping libraries
- **Supabase**: Free tier for database

### AI and Vector Storage
- **OpenAI API**: Free tier credits or minimal cost usage
- **ChromaDB**: Open-source vector database
- **Sentence Transformers**: Open-source embedding models (alternative to OpenAI embeddings)
- **Ollama**: Open-source LLM hosting (alternative to OpenAI)
