- [ ] Implement basic content extraction
- **Testing**: Verify URL validation and basic content extraction from simple websites

### Step 5: Content Processing
- [ ] Implement HTML cleaning (remove ads, navigation, etc.)
- [ ] Extract meaningful text content from HTML
- [ ] Develop content chunking algorithm
- [ ] Store processed content in temporary storage
- **Testing**: Verify clean text extraction from various website types

### Step 6: Vector Database Integration
- [ ] Set up ChromaDB or Pinecone account/instance
- [ ] Implement embedding generation using OpenAI API or open-source alternative
- [ ] Create functions to store and retrieve embeddings

- **Testing**: Verify chat UI functionality and responsiveness

### Step 8: LLM Integration
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration
- [ ] Implement question processing logic
- [ ] Create prompt engineering for context-based answers
- [ ] Develop fallback to open-source alternatives (optional)
- **Testing**: Verify basic Q&A functionality with hardcoded contexts

### Step 9: Semantic Search Implementation
- [ ] Implement vector similarity search
- [ ] Create context assembly from relevant chunks
- [ ] Optimize context window size for LLM
- [ ] Implement answer generation with context
- **Testing**: Verify relevant chunks are retrieved for sample questions

## Phase 4: Session Management and Data Persistence

### Step 10: User Session Management
- [ ] Implement client-side session storage
- [ ] Create session management hooks/context
- [ ] Add functionality to switch between websites
- [ ] Implement chat history per website
- **Testing**: Verify session persistence and website switching

### Step 11: Database Integration
- [ ] Design and implement database schema in Supabase
- [ ] Create API endpoints for session storage and retrieval
- [ ] Implement website metadata storage
- [ ] Add chat history persistence
- **Testing**: Verify data is correctly stored and retrieved from database

## Phase 5: Performance Optimization and Error Handling

### Step 12: Caching Implementation
- [ ] Implement caching for previously scraped websites
- [ ] Add cache invalidation strategy
- [ ] Optimize embedding retrieval
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for chat history
- **Testing**: Verify performance improvements with caching

### Step 13: Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Implement error handling for website scraping failures
- [ ] Add graceful degradation for API failures
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement logging for debugging
- **Testing**: Verify application handles various error scenarios gracefully

### Step 14: Rate Limiting and Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for website scraping
- [ ] Add rate limiting for AI API calls
- [ ] Implement input sanitization
- [ ] Add basic content filtering
- **Testing**: Verify rate limiting and security measures work as expected

## Phase 6: UI/UX Enhancements and Final Testing

### Step 15: UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Enhance chat interface with better styling
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement dark/light mode
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- **Testing**: Verify enhanced UI/UX across devices

### Step 16: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing
- [ ] Test with various website types
- [ ] Conduct performance testing
- [ ] Fix any identified issues
- **Testing**: Verify all features work together seamlessly

### Step 17: Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Prepare deployment configuration for Vercel
- [ ] Deploy application to production
- **Testing**: Verify deployed application works as expected

## Testing Strategy

For each step, implement the following testing approach:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interaction between components
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests for UI/UX elements
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete user flows

## Development Tools

- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **IDE**: VS Code with appropriate extensions
- **API Testing**: Postman or Insomnia
- **Browser DevTools**: For frontend debugging
- **Testing Libraries**: Jest, React Testing Library

## Timeline Estimation

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 weeks

Total estimated time: 8-14 weeks, depending on developer experience and time commitment.
